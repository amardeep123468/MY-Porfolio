Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Maths in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Lovely Professional University](https://www.lpu.in/). My interest in coding started back in 2020 during first year of B.tech . Since then, I started learning programming languages & solving problems based on data structure and algorithms.

Today, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2020-2024) with [8.2 GPA aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1brJbT4YbCdQwL8zRaGmFkkFc2UAJUwH2/view?usp=share_link).

Also I've knowledge of Web Development and created some projects on that using HTML, CSS, Javascript / React.js / Node.js, MongoDB and some other cool libraries and frameworks. I'm also part of some student organisations and Leading one of them. 

Here is a list of the technologies that I've worked with.
